## Project Description 

This project will be a MERN stack application that will focus working with React and MongoDB. The TODO app will display a calendar that the user will be able to interact with. The user will be able to add tasks per day in accordance with time. 

## App Logic

The TODO app will display a calendar that the user will be able to interact with it utilizing an imported library format calendar. We will implement functionality for the user to add tasks per day in accordance to time into the calendar. The app will display a calendar that will have a '+' button indicating to add a task, this will pull up a React card on screen. The user will then be able to enter their task and pick a time of when they should start or end the task(this can be interepted in different ways) and will push it to the calendar by clicking on the 'Done' button at the bottom of the React card. There will be utilizations of GET/PUT routes that will work with card to push the task entries on the calendar. Once the user adds the card, the information should be added to a MongoDB database that holds the user input data(task entries). Once the task is added to the calendar there will be three buttons for the user to use. The first button will be a green check button, once clicked on, it will cross out the task in green and have a green check next to it. The second button will be a red x button, once clicked, it will cross out the task in red and have a red x next to it. The last button will be a delete button, indicated with a garabage logo, it will delete the task despite it being completed, not completed, or left alone. The calendar should be able to display a few words of the task with the buttons overlaping towards the end of the sentence
