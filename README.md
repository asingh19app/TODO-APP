## MVP
- User can move UCB across screen

- The ball changes direction when hits UCB, wall, and or brick

- One line of bricks are removed when they are hit

- Knock out all bricks, indicate user won game


## Post-MVP

- Endgoal will be to destroy all bricks and the user will alerted they completed the task

- A sound will be added when the player hits a brick with the ball

- Use Canvas API
